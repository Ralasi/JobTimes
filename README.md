JobTimesJobTimes
Full Stack Web-based job portal that connects job seekers and recruiters. The platform offers a seamless user experience by utilizing a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. With a user-friendly interface built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

On the back-end, It uses J2EE Application Technologies like JDBC, Servlet, JSP, JSTL and MySQL to manage data efficiently, handle user authentication, and enable smooth interaction between system components. MySQL database stores and retrieves crucial information such as job listings, user profiles, and application details.

The three main roles are admin, recruiter and candidate. The admin role ensures effective platform management, while recruiters can post comprehensive job details, reaching to candidates. Candidates can search for job opportunities, view job descriptions and conveniently apply for positions within the platform.

By centralizing the job search and application processes, JobTimes simplifies the experience for both job seekers and recruiters. Our goal is to optimize the job search journey and enhancing overall efficiency.
